# Matheus Calculator

## My first react app, a simple calculator.

This application uses a library called 'mathjs' (https://mathjs.org/)

To develop this application, it was necessary to learn some basic react skills, which I didn't have.

With this application I learned to develop class components, I know there is also another way to make react components, but I chose to use class components in this project.

First I had to develop the front-end, I confess it was a little complicated, as I only worked with the back-end, but with a little effort and research I managed to do it.

I also learned how to use the 'state' from react, there was a moment when I had a little difficulty talking to the state between the parent and the childs, but with a little research I discovered that it is not possible to create methods and call the state , setState directly from the child, so I created all the calculator methods in the parent component, and through the properties I passed the methods to the children.

It was a very good experience, I think it evolves a little... but I need to evolve even more...


See you in the next project :)
